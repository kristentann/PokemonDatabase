# Potential Challenges
- Linking the database with the frontend might be hard as we don’t have any experience with this

- Writing SQL queries might be daunting as it is something new to all of us.

- Managing changes in requirements during the development process.

- Realizing front end design might be challenging as we are unfamiliar with php syntax and capability.

- Estimating the time required for each task is hard as we have no idea how long a task that we’ve never done before will take.
